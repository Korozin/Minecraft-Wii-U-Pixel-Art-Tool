# Minecraft-Wii-U-Pixel-Art-Tool
This is a tool that allows you to convert PNG files into pixel art and paste them into your Minecraft: Wii U edition worlds!

# Instructions

To run first on Wii U load TCP Gecko and hop on a server, either one you have moderator on or your own.

Next once there, type in your Wii U's IPv4 address into the IP bar and press connect.

Up at the top there is a button labled "..." press that and open a PNG file to load it into the tool. It'll automatically show a picture of the source PNG and a rendered version of the result in game.

From there you can just press paste and wait as it converts the image.

### THIS NEXT STEP IS IMPORTANT

Once you press paste stay in the area you want it to be pasted at, and have your hotbar selected on your FIRST slot and keep it EMPTY so the tool can load the needed blocks into your inventory, 
If you do not this the paste will FAIL.

# To load block presets
Just click load color config and select your .pxl file!
